# Introduction

The Multi-Tower Kit (MTK) is a kit that lets you combine multiple [Juke's Towers of Hell](https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/) (JToH)-styled towers (or any obby made with the JToH Tower Creation Kit) into a single place, in a way that closely resembles a single realm from JToH itself. It uses a batteries-included approach, being distributed as a single place file with scripts and various components of the kit already set up. All you need to do is add the towers and portals, build the lobby, and customize anything else as you seem fit. After that, the place will be fully functional.
