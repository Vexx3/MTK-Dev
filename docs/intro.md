# Getting started

## Introduction

The Multi-Tower Kit (MTK) is a kit that lets you combine multiple [Juke's Towers of Hell](https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/) (JToH)-styled towers (or any obby made with the JToH Tower Creation Kit) into a single place, in a way that closely resembles a single realm from JToH itself. It uses a batteries-included approach, being distributed as a single place file with scripts and various components of the kit already set up. All you need to do is add the towers and portals, build the lobby, and customize anything else as you seem fit. After that, the place will be fully functional.

## Setting up

If you obtained the kit through it’s original, uncopylocked place, or an official place file, everything should already be where they’re supposed to be. However, if you got the kit from some unofficial source, whether it be a free model, modded place download, etc, the setup may require extra steps. These specifics of these extra steps may vary, so they won’t be covered here. Refer to other resources for this, such alternative sources usually provide guides alongside it.

## Setting up other parts of the kit

You may be finished with the important parts of the kit, but there’s still many more features in the kit that are you are free to use or leave alone.
