# Getting started

The Multi-Tower Kit (MTK) is a kit that lets you combine multiple [Juke's Towers of Hell](https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/) (JToH)-styled towers (or any obby made with the JToH Tower Creation Kit) into a single place, in a way that closely resembles a single realm from JToH itself. It uses a batteries-included approach, being distributed as a single place file with scripts and various components of the kit already set up. All you need to do is add the towers and portals, build the lobby, and customize anything else as you seem fit. After that, the place will be fully functional.

## Installation

You can install the kit directly from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Vexx3/MTK-Dev/releases) or the [Template place](https://www.roblox.com/games/6441545053). Download the `.rbxl` file, open it in Roblox Studio, and start building.

## Setting up

- From Official Sources: If you downloaded the kit from the [Releases](https://github.com/Vexx3/MTK-Dev/releases) or the uncopylocked template place, everything is already set up.
- From Other Sources: If obtained from unofficial sources, additional setup may be required. Refer to the guide included with the download or contact the source of support.

## Additional Features

Once the basics are set up, you can explore and customize other features of the kit as needed. These features are optional but can enhance your game.
